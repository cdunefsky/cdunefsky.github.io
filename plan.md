### What I Plan on Doing at University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG)

**First Semester (Happening Now)** <span style="float: right; ">Fall 2020</span>  
For my first semester at UNCG, I will complete the major prerequisites including "The Foundation of Library Science." I also met with my advisor to create a draft of what my time at UNCG will look like. I hope to use this semester to get a better idea of whether or not I want to create a career working in business archives.

**Second Semester** <span style="float: right; ">Spring 2021</span>  
For my second semester, I will be enrolled in "Information sources and services," "Information Organization and Access," and "Archives Management." This semester, I would like to explore the intersection of public history and libraries/archives. I would also like to explore public libraries more and learn about what it means to be a public librarian.

**Summer** <span style="float: right; ">Summer 2021</span>  
During my summer between my first and second year, I plan on enrolling in "Preservation Management." I also plan on starting a new internship and if everything goes well, I would like to continue that internship into the fall semester. During the summer, I would like to reach out to faculty at UNCG and learn more about other parts of both the archive and library field. This information will be helpful in deciding how my final semester will look.

**Third Semester** <span style="float: right; ">Fall 2021</span>  
This semester will be my last at UNCG. I plan on enrolling in "Library administration and management," "Digital Libraries," and the capstone project. I am not sure what I will do yet for the capstone but I hope to use both my first and second semester to draft up some ideas. I also plan on using this semester to start applying for jobs.

### After Graduation

**1 Year Out** <span style="float: right; ">2022</span>  
If my job search was successful, I am likely at a public library or an archive. I plan on using this year to become involved with my state archivist organization and to attend their annual meeting. If I moved for my job, I also plan on using this year to get used to my new place and to settle in before starting on any grand ambitions. If my job search was not successful, I will continue to use this year to search for jobs and work part-time on the side. 

**2 Years Out** <span style="float: right; ">2023</span>
