This website was built in Jekyll, using a modified version of Pudhina's template. I created this portfolio for one of my library science courses, LIS 600, Foundations of Library and Information.   
This website highlights an abridged version of my resume and my projects over the years. I plan on adding to this website over the course of my time at UNCG and my career beyond.
