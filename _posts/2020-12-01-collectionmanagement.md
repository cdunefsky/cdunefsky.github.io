In my fall (2020) semester, I enrolled in LIS 610: Collection Management, a class centered around trends and emerging technologies on collection development within the world of libraries.   

With a team of four, we worked on creating a collections recommendation plan for the North Carolina Room in Asheville. This project took the form of three different parts.   

The first part was an environmental scan of the North Carolina Room (click below to read). The environmental scan explored the current collection issues in the North Carolina Room and was used as a precursory space for solutions to these issues. Each team member selected an issue to research for the second part of this project.

The second part of the project consisted of a libguide (click below to see our libguide). Each member created a mini-collection pertaining to a collection they felt that the North Carolina Room was missing. This collection features a variety of material that the North Carolina Room could purchase or add to their website to bolster their resources. Each mini-collection culminated into a front page that advocated the need for each of these mini-collections.

The last part of the project was a Five-Year Collection Management Plan providing specific steps for the North Carolina Room to take to improve their collection (click below to read). This management plan featured feasible goals on how the North Carolina Room could expand its resources on the aforementioned mini collections.
