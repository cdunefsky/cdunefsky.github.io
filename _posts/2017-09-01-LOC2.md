I assisted in digitization and cataloging of cartoons published in World War I. The assistant director of the Kluge Center (LOC) wanted to create aprogram to teach high school students the history of World War I through a visual medium. During Spring Break in 2017, the LOC invited a few schools to come view these cartoons and learn from WWI historians.
