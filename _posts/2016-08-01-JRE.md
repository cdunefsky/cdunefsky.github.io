With a cohort of twenty-five students from the Montgomery Scholars program, we initiated a project to highlight the contributions of James Reese Europe to the evolution of music and the pioneering of ragtime. My role in the project was to research and create fact sheets so my cohort could host events to educate the public on James Reese Europe.
