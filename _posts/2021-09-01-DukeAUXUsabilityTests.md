University of North Carolina at Greensboro's MLIS program requires a practicum to complete the program. I completed my practicum at Duke University Library's Assessment & User Experience department. This practicum was completed in collaboration with another MLIS student. 

For one of our projects, we created a usability test to garner feedback on Duke University Library's updated staff directory. We recruited students through a Duke University newsletter and completed these tests virtually over Zoom. Using student feedback, we created a report to provide to the Assessment & User Experience department so they could consider how they might implement changes in future iterations of the staff directory.
