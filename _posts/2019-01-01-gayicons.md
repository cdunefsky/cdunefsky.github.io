For a public history project, I created this video, using Adobe Premiere. This video is intended to highlight the value of having gay icons in the LGBTQIA+ community. A gay icon is typically someone who has made LGBTQIA+ rights and issues a major part of their career. Their role in the public sphere shines light onto these issues and pushes forward a broader acceptance for LGTBQIA+ individuals.


Here's the video!
