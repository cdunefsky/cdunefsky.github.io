University of North Carolina at Greensboro's MLIS program requires a practicum to complete the program. I completed my practicum at Duke University's Library Assessment & User Experience department. This practicum was completed in collaboration with another MLIS student. 

For one of our projects, we created an environmental scan investigating accessibility resources at academic libraries across the United States to provide recommendations for Duke University Libraries.
