Here's a little sneak peek of the paper, click below for the full thing!

"In this paper, I will be exploring the influence of power dynamics in developing organizational memory and how that influence shapes the development of a business archive. Prior research has been conducted on each of these individual parts. However, organizational memory is an evolving term, adapting to new technologies and shifting work cultures.
The link between organizational memory and business archives is also in development as archivists strive to demonstrate the value of an archive to corporations. Research on the role of power dynamics and organizational memory in developing business archives is in its infancy.
Little research on it has been conducted. Articles written on organizational memory make note of how power can influence its shape. These articles do not fully dive into how this manipulation of organizational memory might look in the business archive.
I would like to use this paper to create links across these varying fields of research and demonstrate how future research can be done to investigate the role of power in developing a business archive. The links I create do not have a quantitative backing or thorough fieldwork but will hopefully provide a spark to continue this research in the future."
