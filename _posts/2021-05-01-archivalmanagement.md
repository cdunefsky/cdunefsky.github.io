In my Spring 2021 semester at UNCG, I enrolled in LIS 658 - Archival Management. In this course, I worked with three people in creating a recommendation for a local artist on how her work might be used in an educational context. The culmination of this project is a website (featured below), built on HTML and CSS using Github Pages. The website features toolkits my group created to demonstrate how her work could be used in an educational context. My primary responsibility was creating the website.
