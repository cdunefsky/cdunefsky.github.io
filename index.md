title: Hello
subtitle: My name is Chadwick Dunefsky (pronounced Dune + F + Ski). My pronouns are he/him/his. Welcome to my portfolio. This portfolio is intended to be a collection of my projects as I progress through my library career. I only recently received my Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) degree at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, concentrating in archives and public libraries. I hope to add projects from my working career as I grow as a librarian. At the moment, this website primarily features projects I completed throughout my degree. Thank you for reading and if you have any questions, please email me.
