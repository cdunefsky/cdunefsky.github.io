My current academic interests lie in learning how libraries serve as a space to discuss history with an activism lens to promote exposure on overshadowed topics in the past. Libraries are continuing to evolve as free spaces for the public to come together and seek information. How can we use these two ideas to explore topics of gender and find solutions to gender issues within current society?

As a historian, I am interested in gender and LGBTQIA+ issues throughout United States history with a primary focus on the latter half of the twentieth century.

In my free time, I enjoy a nice coffee shop or bubble tea shop with an opened journal by my side. My most recent favorite read was A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara.
